### Notes

[^1]: The snippets bases on the code in the following thread in MODX forum https://forums.modx.com/thread/?thread=32560

[^2]: If the xPDO package is autocreated, the classname in the package is generated by MODX and could be different to a classname set by parameter. If you disable the autoPackage parameter later, please look which classname was generated and change the parameter to that value.
